Sprockets 2
===========

Sprockets 2 is a Rack-based asset packaging system that concatenates
and serves JavaScript, CoffeeScript, CSS, LESS, Sass, and SCSS.

This version is a rewrite of Sprockets that addresses a number of issues
with the original version's design.

* Emphasis on serving, not generating.
* Support for multiple concatenations.
* Support for CSS concatenations.
* Support for CoffeeScript, LESS, Sass and SCSS preprocessing.
* Simplified, header-comment-based dependency declarations.
* Opt-in interpolation with ERB support.
* Serve images and other assets from anywhere in the load path.

More coming soon.
